## What I Build

I design and deploy production-ready machine learning systems — not just models.

- End-to-end ML pipelines (Airflow, MLflow, CI/CD)
- Scalable inference services (FastAPI, Redis caching)
- Distributed data processing (PySpark)
- Cloud-native ML systems (AWS, Docker)
- LLM evaluation and applied GenAI workflows
- Reproducible training-to-serving architecture
